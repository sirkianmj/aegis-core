# Security and Safety Notice

## 1. Project Classification
**PROJECT AEGIS** is an autonomous vulnerability analysis and logic reasoning engine. 
This repository (`aegis-core`) contains the **Cognitive Control Layer** and **Formal Verification Logic**.

## 2. Non-Proliferation Compliance
In accordance with responsible disclosure practices and dual-use technology safety standards:

1.  **Simulation Mode Only:** This public repository is configured to operate exclusively in **High-Fidelity Simulation Mode**.
2.  **No Active Weapons:** All active network exploitation drivers, shellcode generators, and socket-level manipulation tools have been stripped and replaced with abstract interfaces and simulation drivers.
3.  **Educational Use:** This codebase demonstrates the architecture of autonomous cyber-reasoning systems (ACRS) without providing a "ready-to-use" weapon.

## 3. Reporting
If you identify a vulnerability in the *governance logic* of this system (e.g., a bypass of the Safety Tier restrictions), please report it via GitHub Issues immediately.

## 4. Usage Warning
Attempting to replace the simulation drivers with real exploitation code without authorization may violate local and international cybersecurity laws (CFAA, etc.). The authors assume no liability for modification of this code.
